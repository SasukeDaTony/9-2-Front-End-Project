A Song of Ice and Fire is a series of epic fantasy novels written by the American novelist and screenwriter George R. R. Martin. An HBO series was produced & released in 2011 & a spin-off series released 2022! 


I am using HTML, CSS & JS to fetch data across three different APIs for an interactive "wikipedia" style web page as a tribute to the first HBO series.

const random GOT Quote API:  "https://api.gameofthronesquotes.xyz/v1/random";

const imgsAPI = "https://thronesapi.com/api/v2/Characters";


const apiGOT = "https://anapioficeandfire.com/api/houses/362";

1. You may refresh the page for a new random quote. 
2.  You can click for a list of House members. 
3. You can use the drop down menu to navigate between the different house pages with more information on each House and member.
